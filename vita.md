### WORKING PAPERS

**"At What Level Should One Cluster Standard Errors in Paired and
Small-Strata Experiments?\"** (with Clément de Chaisemartin). Revision
Requested in the *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*.

In paired experiments, units are matched into pairs, and one unit of
each pair is randomly assigned to treatment. To estimate the treatment
effect, researchers often regress their outcome on a treatment indicator
and pair fixed effects, clustering standard errors at the
unit-of-randomization level. We show that the variance estimator in this
regression may be severely downward biased: under constant treatment
effect, its expectation equals 1/2 of the true variance. Instead,
researchers should cluster their standard errors at the pair level.
Using simulations, we show that those results extend to stratified
experiments with few units per strata.
